            This initiative, started in colleges across Kerala was intended to
            boost entrepreneurship skills in students and guide them through all
            the steps of their startup journey. Startup school is an elaborate
            one year program where the selected students are guided and trained
            to become exemplary entrepreneurs capable of initiating startups of
            their own. Building these curious minds from ground zero, by
            equipping them with knowledge on all facets of entrepreneurship and
            encouraging them to become the future of tomorrow has always been
            the prime aim of startup schools.

            With the year by year rise in employment scale and a resulting dip
            in opportunities it has to be noted that only the top-notch layer in

            our initiative to urge students to step forward, building and
            helping them with their placement choices and opportunities.
            Industrial connect was aimed to connect students directly with
            professionals who work in different industries so that they would be
            able to analyze and compare on various factors regarding their
            future and ultimately deciding on what they truly want and preparing
            for the same under the guidance of these experts.
